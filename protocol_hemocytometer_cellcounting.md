Protocol: Hemocytometer Cell Counting 
=======================================
Created by SP on 2012-08-14

# Notes:
-	There are several methods of cell counting with a hemocytometer, but all are essentially the same. For alternative methods of counting, see attached literature, or consult other cell counting protocols. 
-	Clean Hemocytometer and cover slip with 70% ethanol and allow to dry prior to use.
# Materials:
1.	Hemocytometer, location: bench drawer near cell counting microscope rm. 226
2.	Trypan Blue Solution (0.4%), Sigma, Lot# 108K2349, CAS# 72-57-1, location: stored at room temperature rm. 226
3.	Microscope, location: rm. 226
# Methods:
1.	Record the volume of the cell suspension and invert or mix with a serological pipet several times. 
2.	Aliquot 10-µL of cell suspension into a 0.65-mL microcentrifuge tube.
3.	Add 10-µL of Trypan Blue to the 10-µL of cell suspension and pipe up and down several times to mix.
4.	Withdrawl 10-µL of cell suspension/Trypan Blue and carefully pipet into hemocytometer until grid surface is covered.
5.	Using the microscope, begin cell counting in the four large squares (each composed of nine smaller squares).
6.	Average the cell count in the four large squares and use the following calculation to obtain the approximate cell concentration (cells/mL)
    a.	(average cell count in large squares)x(dilution factor)x(total cell suspension volume)x(104) = x cells/mL
    b.	Dilution factor in this case is 2
    c.	Total cell suspension is equal to the volume measured in step 1
7.	For viability use the following calculation
    a.	[(# viable cells)/(total # of cells)]x100 = % viable cells
8.	Discard remainder of cell suspension/Trypan Blue in biohazard bin after cell count is recorded.
