# Methods:
## Thawing Cells
1.	Pipet sufficient volume of growth medium into 50-mL conical vial(s) and place medium into 37 degrees C/5% CO2 incubator for at least 30 minutes before use.
    a.	Calculation for medium volume:
2.	Pipet 1-mL of warm growth medium into a 15-mL conical vial. Thaw cells in 37 degree water bath until cell/ice pellet loosens from tube wall and quickly transfer cell/ice pellet to 1-mL of warm growth medium. Add 9-mL of warm growth medium to vial for total volume of approximately 11-mL. Gently invert tube several times.
3.	Remove 20-uL of cells in growth medium and pipet into 0.5-mL microcentrifuge tube for cell count
4.	Add 20-uL of Trypan Blue to the 20-uL aliquot of cells and mix well with pipet. Add 10-uL of mixture into cell counter.
    a.	Record cell counts and show calculations:
5.	After counting cells, centrifuge original cell volume at 1200 RPM at 4 degrees C for 5 minutes.
6.	Remove medium from cells being careful not to disturb the cell pellet and add appropriate volume of fresh warm growth medium. Cells should be seeded between 2x103 and 1x104 cells/cm2. Flask size used will be determined on cell count, but a T-75 should get ~5x105 cells and a T-175 should get ~1x106 cells.
7.	Change medium every 2-3 days and split confluent cultures 1:4 to 1:9 every 4 to 7 days.
## Splitting Cells
1.	Pipet sufficient volume of growth medium into 50-mL conical vial(s) and place medium into 37 degrees C/5% CO2 incubator for at least 30 minutes before use. A vial of trypsin/EDTA must also be thawed in preparation for splitting cells and should be placed in the incubator with the medium after thawing.
2.	Remove growth medium from cell culture flasks with a sterile pipet and suction apparatus. Add trypsin/EDTA to each flask and roll solution back and forth along surface of flask for a few minutes to aid in loosening the cells. After agitating place flasks in incubator. Total trypsinization process should not take longer than 5-7 minutes.
3.	Add warm growth medium (three times the volume of trypsin/EDTA used to lift the cells) to the flask and wash the medium over the complete flask surface several times to recover the cells.
4.	Pipet cells into a conical vial and centrifuge at 1200 RPM at 4 degrees C for 5 minutes
5.	Remove medium from cells being careful not to disturb the cell pellet and add appropriate volume of fresh warm growth medium. Cells should be seeded between 2x103 and 1x104 cells/cm2. Flask size used will be determined on cell count, but a T-75 should get ~5x105 cells and a T-175 should get ~1x106 cells. Record new cell passage number on new flask.
## Freezing Cells
1.	Spin resuspended cells at 1200 RPM for 5 minutes at 4 degrees C.
2.	Remove medium from cells being careful not to disturb the cell pellet and add appropriate volume of cold freeze down solution to obtain 2 or 3 million cells per cryogenic vial. Be sure to properly mix resuspended cells to ensure proper freeze down concentration.
3.	Aliquot 1-mL of cells in freeze down solution in cryogenic vial(s). Work quickly as DMSO is toxic to cells.
4.	Place cryogenic vial(s) in -80 degrees C freezer tray overnight.
5.	Move cryogenic vial(s) to -150 degrees C freezer for storage the following day. Be sure to update the record folder.
