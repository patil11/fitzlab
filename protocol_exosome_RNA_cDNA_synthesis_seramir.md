======================================
Created by PI on 2012-10-25

# Notes:
-	Protocol has been modified from SeraMir Exosome RNA amplification Kit (SBI system Biosciences and SeraMir exosome RNA amplification (see References section).
-	Keep all reagents over ice.

# Materials:
1.	System Biosciences SeraMir Exosome RNA Amplification Kit (Cat# RA800A-1, location refrigerator #1 rm. 231 )
2.	SYBR Master Mix ( Lot #14633900, opened: 11/2009, location refrigerator #5 rm. 231 ) 
3.	Ice

# Methods:
1.	poly A Reaction: 
    ADD - PER REACTION: 
    ExoRNA ( eluted from spin column ) - 5 µL
    5X poly A Buffer - 2 µL
    MnCl2 (25 mM) - 1 µL
    ATP (5 mM) - 1.5 µL
    polyA polymerase - 0.5 µL

2.	Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes. This is saved as EXO1 on thermal cycler. 
3.	Add 0.5µL SeraMir 3’ Adaptor Oligo 
4.	Incubate at 60°C for 5 minutes. This is saved as EXO2 on thermal cycler. 
5.	Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. Then place over ice. 
6.	RT Reaction: 
    ADD - PER REACTION: 
    polyA exoRNA - 10 µL (from above)
    5X RT Master Mix - 4 µL
    5’ SeraMir Switch Oligo - 1 µL
    Reverse Transcriptase - 1 µL
    DEPC water - 4 µL
        20 µL total 
7.	Incubate at 42°C for 30 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes, and hold at 15°C. This is saved as EXO3 on thermal cycler. 
8.	To test the exo-cDNA, perform qPCR using SYBR green: 
    ADD - PER REACTION: 
    exo-cDNA - 0.5 µL (from above; store the rest at -20°C)
    2X SYBR Master Mix - 15 µL
    5’ SeraMir Spike in assay primer - 1 µL
    SeraMir 3’ Reverse qPCR primer - 0.5 µL
    DEPC water - 13 µL
        30 µL total 
9.	Load the samples into the qPCR machine with supporting tubes as needed
10.	Open “Step One” software. 
    - Select “Advance Settings”. Name samples and save data in “Aric Gregson” folder.  
    - Select “Quantitation with ΔCt” 
    - Select “96 well plate” 
    - Select “SYBR GREEN.” Make sure the “Melt Curve” box is checked. 
    -Select “2 hour run” 
    - Select “Plate Settings” and list all targets and samples. 
11.	Exosome cDNA amplification 
    ADD - PER REACTION: 
    ExoRNA amplified cDNA - 2 µL (from above) 
    2X Taq Master Mix - 12.5 µL
    5’ PCR Primer Mix - 1 µL
    DEPC water - 9.5 µL
        25 µL total
12.	Place the reaction in a thermal cycler:
    95°C for 5 minutes 
    35 cycles of:
        95°C for 25 seconds
        60°C for 20 seconds
        72°C for 30 seconds
        72°C for 30 sec
    4°C hold 
This is saved as EXO4 on thermal cycler. 
13.	Store amplified cDNA in -20°C freezer.
